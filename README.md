## Overview

I originally created this repository to explore  [*Projector*](https://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2021/03/11/projector-is-out/)
but that project is now discontinued. But, I can still this repository to explore other things about Intellij like its
support for remote development via SSH, Intellij plugin development, and more.


## Wish List

General clean-ups, changes and things I wish to implement for this project:

* [x] ABANDONED (I don't think this will work on macOS but I tried) Run Projector without Docker. Maybe this will avoid the JVM crash.
* [ ] Merge my project <https://github.com/dgroomes/intellij-plugin-playground> as a sub-project to this Git repo.
* [x] DONE Remove Projector stuff. That project was discontinued and is now part of the closed-source product Gateway (which is
  totally fine; JetBrains can do what they need to do to stay competitive)
