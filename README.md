## Overview

I originally created this repository to explore  [*Projector*](https://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2021/03/11/projector-is-out/)
but that project is now discontinued. But, I can still use this repository to explore other things about Intellij like its
support for remote development via SSH, Intellij plugin development, and more.

**NOTE**:

This was developed on macOS and for my own personal use.

## Container-Based Development via SSH

NOT YET FULLY IMPLEMENTED

Intellij and other JetBrains IDEs support [remote development](https://www.jetbrains.com/remote-development/) via cloud
development environments like [JetBrains Space](https://www.jetbrains.com/space/features/dev-environments.html), [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces),
or you can [orchestrate your own development environment with SSH](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/remote-development-starting-page.html#start_from_IDE).

I'm a fan of cloud development environments for demos, learning expeditions, and open source collaboration but I generally
want more control and power than what the cloud constrains me to and costs. With that in mind, we can create a container-based
development environment that runs an Intellij *IDE backend* and connect to it from an *IDE client* like Intellij or [Gateway](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/remote-development-a.html#gateway)
via SSH. This is what I'll be exploring in this repository.

To make sense of the components and how they work together, refer to [this architecture diagram in the Intellij docs](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/remote-development-overview.html#defs).

We need to create a Docker image and container that hosts the IDE backend and is complete with the development tooling
we need to work on our projects. For me, I often work on Java projects and so I depend on an installation of OpenJDK.
Personally, I find the [Development Containers](https://containers.dev/) project effective and it shows promise for future
investment and improvement. We can define a dev container configuration file (`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`) and use
the [Dev Container CLI](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli) to define and build our ideal development environment! I
have explored the Development Containers project in the context of VS Code and GitHub Codespaces. You can see my notes and working
examples in my repository <https://github.com/dgroomes/vscode-playground>.

Follow these instructions to create a container-based development environment for Intellij:

1. Pre-requisite: npm
   * I'm using npm version 9.2.0.
2. Pre-requisite: Docker
   * I'm using Docker Desktop 4.15.0
3. Install the *Dev Container CLI*
   * ```shell
     npm install --location=global @devcontainers/cli
     ```
4. Build the image
   * ```shell
     devcontainer build --workspace-folder . --image-name intellij-playground-devcontainer
     ```
5. Create and start a container from the image
   * ```shell
     docker run --rm --name intellij-playground-devcontainer --publish 2222:2222 --detach intellij-playground-devcontainer /usr/local/share/ssh-init.sh sleep infinity
     ```
   * Note: At this point, we've ejected from the Dev Container CLI. For the rest of the worfklow we use the Docker image and `docker`
     CLI directly. 
6. Set a password for the non-root dev container Linux user
   * ```shell
     docker exec --interactive --tty intellij-playground-devcontainer passwd vscode
     ```
   * Create a password to your liking. Note: I'm following a workflow here that's similar to the instructions for the ["SSH Server" Dev Container feature](https://github.com/devcontainers/features/tree/main/src/sshd)
     but confusingly, there is a much richer (but maybe outdated?) documentation page [in a VS Code-specific page](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/blob/main/script-library/docs/sshd.md).
     Read that page.
   * Note: The Dev Container CLI and Dev Container SSH feature have created a non-root user called `vscode`. That's not
     very "standards-body". The VS Code and Microsoft influence is strong here, but we'll take it.
7. Test an SSH connection
   * ```shell
     ssh -p 2222 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o GlobalKnownHostsFile=/dev/null vscode@localhost
     ```
   * Use the same user password you created earlier.
8. TODO Connect with Gateway and install the IDE backend.
9. When you're done, stop the container
   * ```shell
     docker stop intellij-playground-devcontainer
     ```
   * Because we started the container with the `--rm` flag, the container will be deleted when it stops.


## Wish List

General clean-ups, changes and things I wish to implement for this project:

* [x] ABANDONED (I don't think this will work on macOS but I tried) Run Projector without Docker. Maybe this will avoid the JVM crash.
* [ ] Merge my project <https://github.com/dgroomes/intellij-plugin-playground> as a sub-project to this Git repo.
* [x] DONE Remove Projector stuff. That project was discontinued and is now part of the closed-source product Gateway (which is
  totally fine; JetBrains can do what they need to do to stay competitive) 
* [ ] IN PROGRESS Create a container-based development environment. Use JetBrains Gateway. Use Dev Containers. Describe
  all instructions.
